[0] See screenshot in same folder as this file. The is a NON-FATAL error during login involving wp-admin/admin-ajax. I'm concerned that this could corrupt the WordPress site in some way. ISSUE: Conflict with FooBox plugin. Must be a scope or focus issue. Maybe the AJAX response is not able to send the response after the iFrame is opened. RESOLUTION: Don't believe that this can cause any damage. Leave as is.

[x] Remove email from autologin. That way there is no chance that a sniffer could grab it.

[x] Key is added repeatedly to <a> repeatedly. 

[x] Use plugin to add "site" to <a> tag.
